    <h2>Things I learned while writing an article about things I learned</h2>
    <p>Last year, I conducted a 12 month experiment related to implementing Code Stewardship at my organization. It went ok; I think I made some progress, and I think I learned some useful things. As a next step, I felt I had these options:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Do nothing; maybe switch focus to some other initiative</li>
      <li>Extend the experiment; i.e., continue working on it</li>
      <li>Share what I'd learned; e.g. internal blog post, post on my web site, perhaps write a talk and submit to a conference somewhere</li>
    </ol>
    <p>I was having trouble deciding which one to choose. I procrastinated on making the decision for a month or so, but not deciding was bothering me. I felt like I was starting to default to Option 1, but if that's where things ended up I wanted it to be a conscious decision rather than just the path of least resistance.</p>
    <p>I realized that I probably didn't have enough information to make the decision, which could be why I kept putting it off. For example, how could I decide between Option 1 and Option 2 if I didn't take time to think really critically about what impact my work was having? I decided to try Option 3, but to allow myself the potential outcome of not ever sharing what I wrote if it didn't feel useful enough.</p>
    <p><a href="resources/Code Stewardship - Summary and Reflection.pdf" target="_blank">Here's the article I wrote.</a> (I did end up sharing it with several people at my organization.)</p>
    <p>And here's what I learned while writing that article:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Taking the time to retro on things I do, especially things I spent a lot of time on, just feels better. I think I prefer being sure that I haven't achieved something, over not being sure if I did. Closure is important.</li>
      <li>Summarizing and reflecting is a great way to uncover things I've learned or taken away from an experience that I didn't realize I had. Exactly what I've learned is not always obvious.</li>
      <li>If I do decide to share my reflections, other people will have really cool perspectives and thoughts about what I did that I may not have considered. Being really close to the work for a long time means it's hard to think about it in new ways.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I better stop here. My manager says that if I think too hard about this, I might end up in an infinite loop.</p>
    <p>...what did I learn while writing this article about things I learned while writing an article about things I learned...? :)</p>
