    <h2>It's not for you, it's for me.</h2>
    <p>I'm making this web site because I want to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Have a place where I can share slides from my talks</li>
        <li>Practice writing</li>
        <li>Document/observe how my learning and interests change over time</li>
        <li>Practice working with technology I don't normally get around to playing with</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If others can also benefit from what I post here, that's even better! But it's not required.</p>
    <p>I think this will be important for me to remember. If I don't post here unless I am certain that others will benefit from what I'm saying, I'll probably never write anything :)  </p>
